# ClockToDecimal

A simple Python script to convert clock times (in HHMM format) to decimal hours and calculate the total time between two points, optionally subtracting a break.

## Features

- Converts time from HHMM (e.g., 0930) to decimal hours (e.g., 9.5)
- Calculates the difference between start and end times
- Subtracts a 30-minute break from the total time
- Interactive command-line interface

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python timeomregner.py
    ```
2. Enter the start and end times in HHMM format when prompted (e.g., 0800 for 8:00 AM).
3. The script will display the total time and the total time minus a 30-minute break.
4. Press `9` and Enter to exit, or just Enter to continue.
